## Loops in Python: downward pyramid pattern of stars

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to print the downward pyramid pattern of stars

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Read an integer rows from the user (number of pattern rows).
2. Loop i from rows + 1 down to 1 (decreasing order).
3. Inside the loop, run another loop j from 0 to i - 2 to control the number of stars in each row.
4. Print "* " for each j, staying on the same line.
5. After the inner loop finishes, move to the next line using print(" ").

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~
rows = int(input())
for i in range(rows + 1, 0, -1):
    for j in range(0, i - 1):
        print("*", end=' ')
    print(" ")
